Region Fixer 0.0.1

This is a little script that tries to fix corrupted chunks in region files using old backup copies of the minecraft world. If you don't have a copy, you can eliminate the corrupted chunks.

Supported platforms: Should work where python does.

For more information run “python region-fixer.py --help”

This is the very first version of the program and works perfectly for me. But the bugs always appear, so please, MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR WORLD BEFORE RUNNING THIS, I'M NOT RESPONSIBLE OF WHAT HAPPENS TO YOUR WORLD. Think that you are playing with you precious saved games :P .

Good luck! :)
